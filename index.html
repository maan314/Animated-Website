                <h3>Jujutsu Sorcerer-</h3>
                <p>Jujutsu Sorcerers (呪じゅ術じゅつ師し Jujutsushi?) are individuals secretly trained and employed by the government in Japan to defend humanity from cursed spirits.
                  The race of humans capable of using jujutsu are colloquially known as Sorcerers (術じゅつ師し Jutsushi?), and the jujutsu prefix is often used to signify their alignment to Jujutsu High. Jujutsu sorcerers who use their powers for criminal purposes, such as murder, are called Curse Users (呪じゅ詛そ師し Jusoshi?) while humans who cannot use jujutsu are called Non-Sorcerers (非ひ術じゅつ師し Hijutsushi?).</p>

                <p>Back when Satoru was a student, he was extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible, his opinion of others often only going as far as his judgement of their strength, and he was quite apathetic towards anyone he deems weak. Additionally, greatly influenced by his own desire for power, he was very arrogant, convinced that he is the strongest in the world, which he technically is, claiming that "throughout the Heavens and earth, he alone is the honored one.".</p>
